 * interactive Jupyter pyplot
> **Geometric Algebra should be computationally interactive**
> Python in a Jupyter file is presently the best way   
> to promote and teach ALTrans, which is dimensionless geometry.
> The current name for this new language is Geometric Algebra, 
> which is a misnomer, because this is a superAlgebra, 
> where GA (Geometric Algeba) is the Cl(3,0) Euclidean signature.
____
> ALTrans is correctly implemented in the [clifford] module,
> available here at gitHub from [pygae]. Brilliant work. 
> From the same authors comes pyganja, for displaying "GA".
> GA (ALTrans, pref.) must be translated back to coordinate form,
> in order to interface with traditional algebra. 
> But no GA system yet has interactive GA computation.
> Toward this end, Æ builds a bridge from [clifford] to pyplot. 
____
> Unfortunately, current pyplot technology relies on ipywidgets,
> which are notoriously difficult to implement in Jupyter.
> No longer. Enjoy, and stay tuned.
